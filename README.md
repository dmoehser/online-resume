# Online Resume - My First Web Project

A simple HTML resume website I built when I was just starting to learn web development. Nothing fancy, but it shows where I began my coding journey.

## What I Built

- Basic HTML structure with proper elements
- Clean layout that's easy to read
- Contact page with my details
- Professional resume format
- HTML tables (tr, td) for organizing data
- Multiple pages with simple navigation

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Basic markup and structure
- **CSS** - Inline styling for the footer
- **JavaScript** - Simple dynamic year update

## 📁 Project Structure
